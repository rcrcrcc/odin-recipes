                <div>
                    In a large bowl, mix the yeast with 1/2 cup of the warm water and the 
                    sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups of warm water, flour, and 
                    kosher salt and stir dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface and knead, 
                    adding flour as necessary until a silky and soft dough forms. Use a pastry scraper to help 
                    knead the dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and brush all over with olive oil. 
                    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or for up to 3 days.
                </div>
                <div>
                   T Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface; punch down and divide into 4 pieces. Form each piece 
                   into a ball. Rub each ball with oil and transfer to a baking sheet. Cover the balls loosely with 
                   plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free lace for 1 hour.
                </div>
                <div>
                    meanwhile, set a pizza stone in the oven and preheat the oven to 500&#8457, allowing at least
                    45 minutes for the stone to heat. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill set over a medium bowl or pulse 
                    them in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Stir in the oregano and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil 
                    and season generously with salt and pepper.
                </div>
                <div>
                    On a lightly floured surface, stretch one ball of dough into a 13-inch round; transfer to a floured pizza peel, adding flour where the dough sticks. 
                    Spread 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce over the dough to within 1 inch of the edge. Spread one-fourth 
                    of the cheese over the pizza and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Season with sea salt and pepper and 
                    slide the pizza onto the stone. Bake until the bottom is charred and the cheese is melted, about 8 minutes. 
                    Scatter one-fourth of the basil on top and let stand for 3 minutes before serving. Repeat 
                    with the remaining dough and toppings.
